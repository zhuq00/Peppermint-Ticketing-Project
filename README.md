# Peppermint-Ticketing-Project

## Overview  
This project simulates a professional Help Desk environment using the Peppermint ticketing platform (deployed with WSL2 + Docker).  
The goal was to practice IT service management workflows, apply ITIL-based practices, and demonstrate technical deployment skills in a real-world ticketing system.  

## Skills Learned  
- ITIL-based ticket management (categorization, SLA tracking, escalation paths)  
- Incident handling for IT support (password resets, VPN issues, phishing reports, malware remediation, hardware troubleshooting, onboarding)  
- Service documentation and SLA compliance reporting  
- Deployment and configuration of enterprise platforms with Docker, PostgreSQL, and Linux  

## Tools Used  
- Peppermint (open-source ticketing platform)  
- WSL2 + Ubuntu  
- Docker & Docker Compose  
- PostgreSQL  

## Documentation

## Project Highlights  
- Deployed Peppermint ticketing system with Docker + PostgreSQL in WSL2.  
- Created and resolved **10+ IT support tickets** simulating real-world Help Desk requests.  
- Applied **ITIL practices** (incident categorization, SLA tracking, escalation).  
- Produced documentation & compliance reports to mirror professional Help Desk operations.  
- Demonstrated technical deployment skills in Linux, Docker Compose, and PostgreSQL.  

## Future Improvements  
- Integrate ticketing workflows with SOAR platforms (e.g., Shuffle).  
- Automate SLA reporting with scripts.  
- Expand ticket categories to include SOC-related incidents.
